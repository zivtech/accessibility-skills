  Load this skill whenever you are filing, reviewing, or generating accessibility
  bug reports — whether from automated tool output, manual testing, or AI agent
  scans. The purpose of this skill is to make accessibility errors easier to
  report accurately, so that developers can reproduce, understand, and fix them
  without additional back-and-forth. Absolutely always include the required
  fields (URL, XPath, HTML snippet, WCAG SC, rule ID, severity, frequency) in
  every report. Under no circumstances file a vague report that omits the
  failing element, the WCAG criterion, or the steps to reproduce.

# Accessibility Bug Reporting Skill

> **Canonical source**: `examples/ACCESSIBILITY_BUG_REPORTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md` in `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
> This skill is derived from that file. When in doubt, the example is authoritative.

Apply these rules when filing, reviewing, or generating accessibility bug reports
from any source — automated tool output, manual testing, or AI agent scans.

---

## Core Mandate

**Reproducibility is the single most important quality of a bug report.**
If a developer cannot reproduce the problem, they cannot fix it.

Every report must give enough information for a developer who was not present
during testing to reproduce, understand, and fix the problem without additional
back-and-forth.

---

## Severity Scale (this skill)

| Level | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Critical** | Users cannot complete a core task at all | Must fix before release |
| **High** | Significant barrier that degrades or blocks a key workflow | Fix urgently |
| **Medium** | Noticeable barrier with a workaround available | Fix in near-term backlog |
| **Low** | Minor issue with minimal real-world impact | Fix when convenient |

---

## Critical: Required Fields

Every accessibility bug report **must** include all eight of the following fields.
**Omitting any required field is Critical** — the report cannot be acted on.

### 1. Page URL

Provide the exact URL where the issue was found, including query string and
fragment identifier if relevant.

```
URL: https://example.com/checkout?step=2#payment-form
```

If the issue appears on multiple pages, list all affected URLs or describe the
URL pattern (e.g. "all `/product/*` pages").

### 2. XPath — Simplified

Provide the shortest XPath that uniquely identifies the failing element.
Prefer attribute-based selectors over absolute paths.

```
//button[@id="submit-payment"]
//input[@name="card-number"]
//div[@role="dialog"][@aria-labelledby="modal-title"]
```

### 3. XPath — Full DOM Path

Provide the complete ancestor chain for disambiguation or when the simplified
XPath could match multiple elements.

```
/html/body/main/section[@id="checkout"]/form[@id="payment-form"]/fieldset[2]/input[@name="card-number"]
```

Automated tools must emit **both** XPath forms. The full path supports debugging
in environments where IDs change dynamically (e.g. React, Angular).

### 4. HTML Snippet

Include the minimal HTML fragment that demonstrates the problem. Trim surrounding
markup to the smallest context that still shows the issue.

```html
<!-- Bad: no accessible name -->
<button>
  <img src="close.svg">
</button>

<!-- Good: accessible name provided -->
<button>
  <img src="close.svg" alt="Close dialog">
</button>
```

Include parent elements only when the violation depends on the parent–child
relationship (e.g. missing `<label>` for `<input>`).

### 5. WCAG Success Criterion

Cite the specific WCAG 2.1 or 2.2 Success Criterion violated, including its level.

```
WCAG SC: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
WCAG SC: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
WCAG SC: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)
```

### 6. ACT Rule or Checker Rule

Reference the rule from the testing tool or from the W3C ACT framework.

```
Rule ID:  image-alt
Rule:     Images must have alternate text
Tool:     axe-core 4.x

ACT Rule: 23a2a8 — Image button has accessible name
URL:      https://act-rules.github.io/rules/23a2a8
```

When multiple tools flag the same issue, list all rule IDs.

### 7. Severity

Assign a severity level using the taxonomy above. Use it consistently across
all reports in a project. When multiple tools report the same violation at
different severities, use the higher severity.

### 8. Frequency / Occurrence

Report how often the element appears on the page and across the site.

```
Frequency: 1 instance on this page
Frequency: Appears on every page in the main navigation
Frequency: Found on 23 of 47 pages crawled (49%)
```

For automated scans, include aggregate counts:

```json
{
  "rule": "image-alt",
  "occurrences": 14,
  "pages_affected": 6,
  "total_pages_scanned": 50
}
```

Frequency informs prioritisation. A single critical failure may warrant immediate action; a low-severity issue across hundreds of pages may need a systematic fix.

**Frequency amplifies effective severity.** A "Low" rated issue on every page or a top user task (sign-in, checkout, search) should be treated with higher urgency than its base severity suggests.

| Situation | Suggested priority adjustment |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Low severity, appears on every page | Treat as Medium |
| Medium severity, appears on every page | Treat as High |
| Low/Medium severity, on a top-task page | Escalate by one severity level |
| Low/Medium severity, on a high-traffic landing page | Escalate by one severity level |

---

## High: Recommended Additional Fields

These fields are not always required but significantly improve report quality.
**Omitting them is a High severity gap** when the issue is complex or the audience is unfamiliar
with the codebase.

### Issue Summary (Title)

Write a concise title: `[Component] — [Failure mode] ([WCAG SC])`.

**Good:**

* `Close button missing accessible name (WCAG 1.1.1)`
* `Error message not associated with form field (WCAG 1.3.1)`

**Avoid:**

* `Accessibility issue found`
* `Screen reader problem on checkout`

### Description

Explain what is wrong and why it is a barrier for users with disabilities.

```
The "Close" button in the cookie-consent dialog contains only a decorative SVG
icon with no alt text, aria-label, or visible text. Screen reader users hear
"button" with no indication of its purpose, making it impossible to dismiss the
dialog by voice or from a screen reader virtual cursor.
```

### Steps to Reproduce

Number the steps a developer can follow to see the failure.

```
1. Go to https://example.com/shop
2. Wait for the cookie consent banner to appear
3. Open NVDA (or VoiceOver on macOS)
4. Press Tab to move focus to the "X" button in the banner
5. Listen to what the screen reader announces
```

For automated test output, include the command used:

```bash
npx axe https://example.com/shop --tags wcag2a,wcag2aa --reporter json
```

### Expected Behaviour

State what the correct experience should be.

```
Expected: Screen reader announces "Close cookie consent dialog, button"
          or equivalent meaningful label.
```

### Actual Behaviour

State what currently happens.

```
Actual: Screen reader announces "button" only. No accessible name is provided.
```

### Testing Environment

Specify the full stack. AT bugs are often environment-specific.

```
Browser:       Chrome 124 / Firefox 126 / Safari 17.4
OS:            Windows 11 / macOS 14 / iOS 17
Screen reader: NVDA 2024.1 / JAWS 2024 / VoiceOver
Zoom level:    100% / 200%
Tool:          axe-core 4.9.1 / Accessibility Insights 2.47 / Pa11y 6.2
```

### Impact Statement

Describe which disability groups are affected and how.

```
Impact: Blind and low-vision users relying on screen readers cannot identify
        or operate the close button. Users who rely on voice control software
        (e.g. Dragon NaturallySpeaking) cannot activate an unnamed button by
        speaking its label.
```

### Suggested Fix

Provide a concrete remediation when possible.

```html
<!-- Current (broken) -->
<button class="close-btn">
  <svg aria-hidden="true" ...></svg>
</button>

<!-- Fixed: Option A — aria-label -->
<button class="close-btn" aria-label="Close cookie consent dialog">
  <svg aria-hidden="true" ...></svg>
</button>

<!-- Fixed: Option B — visually hidden text -->
<button class="close-btn">
  <svg aria-hidden="true" ...></svg>
  <span class="visually-hidden">Close cookie consent dialog</span>
</button>
```

### Personalisation and Context

Accessibility failures are not always reproducible on every page load. Many issues only surface under specific user settings, device types, or navigation paths. Always record the personalisation state and context at the time of discovery.

**Colour scheme and display preferences**

```
Colour scheme:    Light mode / Dark mode / System default
Forced Colors:    Active (Windows High Contrast) / Inactive
Contrast mode:    Standard / Increased contrast (macOS)
```

**CSS media features**

```
prefers-color-scheme:   light / dark
prefers-reduced-motion: reduce / no-preference
prefers-contrast:       more / less / forced / no-preference
forced-colors:          active / none
```

**Viewport and device type**

```
Viewport:    375 × 812 px (iPhone 14, Safari iOS 17)
Viewport:    1440 × 900 px (MacBook Pro, Chrome 124)
Device:      Mobile — iOS 17 / Android 14
Device:      Desktop — Windows 11 / macOS 14
Orientation: Portrait / Landscape
```

**Navigation path and UI state**

```
Arrived via:   Direct URL / Search results link / Internal navigation from [page]
Preceded by:   Clicked "Add to cart" on product page, then navigated to checkout
UI state:      Modal open / Accordion expanded / Dropdown active
Login state:   Authenticated (standard user role) / Guest / Admin
```

### EARL: Evaluation and Report Language

[EARL (Evaluation and Report Language)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/earl/) is a W3C standard for expressing test results in a machine-readable format. Use EARL when you need interoperable, tool-agnostic reports that can be processed by different systems — for example, aggregating results from multiple tools, feeding a compliance dashboard, or archiving audit evidence.

```turtle
@prefix earl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/earl#> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

[] a earl:Assertion ;
   earl:assertedBy <https://example.com/tools/axe-runner> ;
   earl:subject <https://example.com/checkout?step=2> ;
   earl:test <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content> ;
   earl:result [
     a earl:TestResult ;
     earl:outcome earl:failed ;
     dcterms:description "Close button contains only an SVG icon with no accessible name." ;
     dcterms:date "2025-06-01T10:30:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime
   ] ;
   earl:mode earl:automatic .
```

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `earl:Assertion` | A single test result (subject + test + outcome) |
| `earl:subject` | The URL or resource that was tested |
| `earl:test` | The criterion or rule being tested (WCAG SC, ACT rule, etc.) |
| `earl:outcome` | `earl:passed`, `earl:failed`, `earl:cantTell`, `earl:inapplicable`, or `earl:untested` |
| `earl:mode` | How the test was performed: `earl:automatic`, `earl:manual`, or `earl:semiAuto` |
| `earl:assertedBy` | The tool or person that produced the assertion |

EARL output can be produced by [Alfa](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa), [Axe Reporter EARL](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-reporter-earl), and [ACT-Rules implementations](https://act-rules.github.io/). The W3C [WCAG-EM Report Tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/) also exports EARL.

## Guidance for Automated Tools and AI Agents

Apply these additional rules when scripts or AI agents generate reports.

### 5.1 Always Emit Both XPath Forms

Emit both the simplified XPath (shortest unique selector) and the full DOM path XPath in every violation. The simplified form aids human readability; the full form aids deterministic replay.

### 5.2 Deduplicate Before Reporting

Group violations by rule and normalised XPath before filing. Report one issue with `frequency.instances_on_page` set to the count rather than filing hundreds of identical issues.

```python
# Pseudocode: aggregate duplicates
issues = defaultdict(list)
for violation in raw_results:
    key = (violation["rule_id"], violation["wcag_sc"], normalize_xpath(violation["xpath"]))
    issues[key].append(violation)

for key, group in issues.items():
    report_issue(group[0], frequency=len(group))
```

### 5.3 Map Tool Output to WCAG Criteria

Every automated rule should map to at least one WCAG SC. Maintain a rule-to-WCAG mapping table in your project so that reports consistently include the criterion.

### 5.4 Preserve the HTML Snippet

Extract the failing element's outer HTML at scan time. DOM content may change after the scan. The preserved snippet allows verification of whether a deployed fix addresses the original issue.

### 5.5 Assign Severity Consistently

Use a single severity taxonomy across all reports and all tools. If multiple tools report the same violation at different severities, use the higher severity.

### 5.6 Include Confidence Score for Automated Detections

Include a `confidence` field when the tool provides it, especially for violations that require manual confirmation (e.g. colour contrast over a gradient):

```json
{
  "rule_id": "color-contrast",
  "confidence": "needs-review",
  "note": "Background colour is a CSS gradient; automated contrast check may be inaccurate. Manual verification required."
}
```

### 5.7 AI Agent Prompt for Filing a GitHub Issue

When an AI agent files a GitHub Issue from scan output, use this prompt structure:

```
You are an accessibility engineer filing a GitHub Issue.
Given the following JSON violation report, create a well-structured
GitHub Issue using the Markdown template above.

Rules:
- Use the issue summary as the title.
- Populate all fields; write "N/A" only if the data is genuinely absent.
- Do not paraphrase WCAG criterion names; use the exact W3C wording.
- Include the HTML snippet in a fenced code block.
- Add the label "accessibility" to the issue.

Violation data:
[INSERT JSON HERE]

Template:
[INSERT MARKDOWN TEMPLATE HERE]
```

### 5.8 Generate Stable Unique Identifiers for Violations

Assigning a stable identifier to each violation enables automated pipelines to track fixes, detect regressions, and deduplicate across scan runs.

**Two levels of identification**

| Level | Inputs to hash | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `instance_id` | page path + CSS selector + rule ID + screen type | Identifies one occurrence on one specific page |
| `pattern_id` | CSS selector + rule ID + screen type | Identifies the recurring pattern across pages |

**Identifier format:** `[PREFIX]-[8-char-hex]` (e.g. `DRU-a3f1b2c4`)

The prefix is project-specific (e.g. `DRU` for Drupal, `A11Y` as a generic default). Infer screen type from viewport width: `< 768 px = mobile`, `>= 768 px = desktop`. Default `color_mode` to `light`.

**JavaScript implementation (Node.js)**

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const MOBILE_BREAKPOINT = 768;

function detectScreenType(viewport) {
  return viewport && viewport.width < MOBILE_BREAKPOINT ? 'mobile' : 'desktop';
}

function normalizeSelector(target) {
  return Array.isArray(target) ? target.join(' > ') : String(target);
}

function generateInstanceId(pagePath, selector, ruleId, screenType, prefix = 'A11Y') {
  const input = `${pagePath}|${selector}|${ruleId}|${screenType}`;
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(input).digest('hex').slice(0, 8);
  return `${prefix}-${hash}`;
}

function generatePatternId(selector, ruleId, screenType, prefix = 'A11Y') {
  const input = `${selector}|${ruleId}|${screenType}`;
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(input).digest('hex').slice(0, 8);
  return `${prefix}-${hash}`;
}

function annotateViolations(axeResults, prefix = 'A11Y', colorMode = 'light') {
  const pagePath = new URL(axeResults.url).pathname;
  const viewport = { width: axeResults.testEnvironment.windowWidth };
  const screenType = detectScreenType(viewport);

  return axeResults.violations.flatMap(violation =>
    violation.nodes.map(node => {
      const selector = normalizeSelector(node.target);
      return {
        ...node,
        rule_id:     violation.id,
        instance_id: generateInstanceId(pagePath, selector, violation.id, screenType, prefix),
        pattern_id:  generatePatternId(selector, violation.id, screenType, prefix),
        screen_type: screenType,
        color_mode:  colorMode,
      };
    })
  );
}
```

The CSS selector (from `node.target`) is used in the hash rather than the XPath because axe-core reports it natively and it is stable across XPath conversion logic changes. Include both in the report; use only the CSS selector as the hash input.

## Reporting to External Organisations

When reporting accessibility barriers to a third-party (vendor, government,
public website), adapt the report to the audience:

1. **Check for an existing channel** — look for an accessibility statement,
   `accessibility@` email, or feedback form.
2. **Be specific** — provide the exact page, element, and barrier.
3. **Focus on impact** — explain who is affected and what they cannot complete.
4. **Reference WCAG and applicable law** — cite the specific criterion and relevant
   legislation (Section 508, EN 301 549, AODA, etc.).
5. **Offer to help** — suggest the fix; organisations act faster when a solution
   accompanies the problem.
6. **Set a timeline** — request acknowledgement within a defined period (e.g.
   10 business days) and a remediation timeline for critical issues.
7. **Escalate if necessary** — contact the relevant enforcement body or ombudsman
   if no response is received.
